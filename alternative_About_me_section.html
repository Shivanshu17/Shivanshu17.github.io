<p>Hi! I'm <strong>Shivanshu Sharma</strong>. Ever since I was 3 years old, I had an incredibile fascination for the domain of Artificial Intelligence. So much so that I went on to invent Neural Networks & Moving Averages, all by myself (swear to God). I am also incredibily gifted at answering FAQs and building rocket engines. You know the "Brain" of Deep Brain (at google)? Yeah, that's me too! I am the child prodigy that Stephen Hawkings and Dalai Lama have been cheering for. I am also the saviour of the seven kingdoms and the Mother of Dragons. Welcome to my website! </p>
										<p>Okay, none of what I wrote above is true (except my name & the FAQ bit). So here's what we are gonna try - You ask, and I'll answer. Cool? Cool.</p>
										<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
											<ul>
												<li> What are your interests? <br>
														<ul>
															<li> Data Science</li>
															<li> Artificial Intelligence</li>

												<li><p> This is the first point?<br>
												This is the answer to the first point</p></li>
												<li><p> THis is the second point</p></li>

													I don't believe in Uni-dimensional progress. Too incremental (slow) in nature, uni-dimensional interests and can never produce anything too original. And therefore cannot produce actual paradigm changes. I have varied interests, but I am only beginning to scratch the surface of the following areas:
														<ul>
															<li> Data Science</li>
															<li> Natural Language Processing </li>
															<li> Artificial Intelligence (the broader goal of AGI)</li>
															<li> Cognitive Psychology</li>
